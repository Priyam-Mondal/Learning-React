// create and use store in redux => 

// 1. Create store using configureStore()
// 2. create slice using createSlice(); A slice combines the reducer logic, actions, and initial state in one place.

// 3. reducers functions provides with two things - state, action

// action: actions contains all value that we pass to function(use action.payload to access the value)
// state: it contains the current state of the store

// 4. export actions from slice
// 5. export reducer from slice
// 6. add reducer/s in store.js
// 7. now you can import individual reducer functions in whichever component you want
// 8. useDispatch is used to send actions to store
// 9. useSelector is used to fetch state from store
